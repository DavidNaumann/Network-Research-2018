## Resilient Cyber-Physical Systems with Application to Vehicle-to-Vehicle Collision Avoidance

### Authors: Arul Mathi Chandran, Shanshan Bi, Kenneth David Naumann and Jared Hanisch


The research consisted of looking into vehicle-to-vehicle communication in which the cars shared information of thier position, speed, steering-wheel position, brake status, and other data to other vehicles within a short distance of other vehicles. In looking into these complex situations we aimed to investigate into flaws that would occur within the situations and furthermore find improvements that could be made to avoid fatal collisions.
